# file: hangman.py is a program that (put the description of the program)
# input: enter the length of the word you want to guess and the number of lives 
#        that you want to have and start inputing letter guesses for the hidden word
# output: outputs if you guess a letter correctly, incorrectly, 
#         and outputs game state on a win or a loss
